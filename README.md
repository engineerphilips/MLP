# A Multilayer Feedforward Perceptron Model in Neural Networks for Predicting Stock Market Shortâ€‘term Trends

The project aims to examine the predictability of the fundamental and technical analyses of stock data using a multilayer feedforward perceptron neural network (MLP) and determine whether the model is capable of accurately predicting stock market short-term trends.

Technical analysis of stock data using a multilayer feedforward perceptron neural network (MLP) is done so far, fundamental and hybrid analyses follows next.

Technology companies whose data is available on NASDAQ website and yahoo finance were chosen. Financial ratios of the companies are the main input variables
in fundamental analysis of the stock market. We focus on twenty-four financial ratios compiled from the financial statements of the Technology companies.
